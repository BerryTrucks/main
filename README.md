# BerryTrucks

## Our mission
We are BlackBerry 10 platform fans and users. BB10 is a unique development in technology featuring the QNX operating system coupled with a streamlined UI and a lot of innovation on the UI side. The BB10 apps are quick, smart and fluid. BerryTrucks are here to:

* Collect and preserve the native BlackBerry 10 apps
* Foster the BB10 free/libre open source ecosystem by tweaking and improving the existing apps
* Suggest a new development and distribution channel not tied to a central vendor

## Where to from here?

* Explore the available [apps](https://github.com/BerryTrucks)
* Read the [wiki](https://github.com/BerryTrucks/main/wiki)
* Start hacking!
